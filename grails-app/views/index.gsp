        <h1 class="text-center">The new GroovyBlogs is coming.</h1>
        <p>
            The old groovyblog's hosting provider stopped their sponsorship on Sept. 1st. Since then we have been working hard on
            getting it back online.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are reusing the code that Glen Smith wrote (running on Grails 1.2) and are revamping it to run on the latest Grails. This
            takes a little time, so please bear with us.
        </p>
        <p>
            The good part is, that the feeds are running again and that you can read the RSS feeds again.
        </p>
        <p>
            The new GroovyBlogs are run by the team behind <a href="http://gr8conf.org">GR8Conf</a> and the hosting is sponsored by <a href="http://easyspeedy.com">EasySpeedy</a>
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-center">Please stay tuned while we get the rest of the site working again</h3>
