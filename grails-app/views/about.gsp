    <p>
        groovyblogs was first created by <a href="http://blogs.bytecode.com.au/glen" target="_blank">Glen Smith</a> in March 2007 (according to
        <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070302182955/http://www.groovyblogs.org/entries/recen">archive.org</a>). Back then it was build on
        Grails 0.4.2! Since then it had undergone upgrades and improvements, reaching Grails 1.2.x. Then in September 2014 the previous hosting
        provider stopped its sponsorship, and Glen felt that it was time to move on; asking the team behind <a href="http://gr8conf.eu">GR8Conf Europe</a>
        if they would take over.
    </p>

    <p>
        The relaunch groovyblogs.org is largely based on Glen's work. When we got the code it was still build to run
        on Grails 1.2.x and was using jSecurity for login. We have reused large portions of Glen's work, but had to replace some of it
        to get it running on Grails 2.4.x. The biggest changes are the replacement of jSecurity in favor of Spring Security and
        revamping the UI using Twitter Bootstrap.</p>

    <p>
        The new groovyblogs.org is maintained by the team behind <a href="http://gr8conf.eu">GR8Conf Europe</a> and the hosting is
        sponsored by <a href="http://easyspeedy.com">EasySpeedy</a>
